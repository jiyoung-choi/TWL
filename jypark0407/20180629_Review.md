# Why do we need Statistics?

## Basics of Statistics
*	모집단과 표본 - 어느 정도 일치하는 가?

변수 (P) : Variable

자료 (N) : Observation

* Average, Minimum, Maximum, Median

- Average vs Median : Median less likely to be affected by outliers

*Deviation : Difference between the variable and the average

*Standard Deviation

* 차원의 저주 (Curse of Dimensionality)
변수가 늘어날 수록 필요한 데이터의 양이 기하급수적으로 증가.
차원의 증가에 따라 데이터의 밀도는 급소로독 희박 (Sparse)

* 변수가 많을 때 줄이는 법

* Python
Open source Programming Language
Quality of analytics depends on the programming skills

* SEMMA
	Exploration : Visualize the data and describe it

* EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

# Why do we need Git?
Git is a version control system that acts as a log for computer files and a platform for collaborative software development.

1. Install Git on Mac. Check the current version of Git
`$ git --version`
2. Initialize git
`$ git init`
3. Create File
`echo "# destinationl directory" >> "filename"`
4. *Add* File
`git add "filename"`
5. *Committ* File
`git commit -m "message"`
6. *Push* file
`git push -u "remote server name" master
(Remote server should be added before the push. `git add remote "remote server name" "HTTPS/SSH Server Address")

`git status` : Check uncommitted status

`On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean`
--> `rm -rf .git/` : Delete initialization file (in case of repetition)
