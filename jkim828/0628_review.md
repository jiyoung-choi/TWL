# Today I learned / 26-June, 2018
## The reason we have to use git / github when working 
   - It has a ledger (history) about what we have done before
   - Automatic-update-functions
## Git & github
   - Github : A web-based hosting service for version control using Git
   - Git : A version control system for tracking changes in computer files 
           and coordinating work on those files among multiple people
## Functions that I should get used to
   - pull request 
     Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. 
     Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes 
     with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.
   - merge
   - commit
